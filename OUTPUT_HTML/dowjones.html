<h1 class="blue"><b>THE DOW JONES PRIVACY POLICY</b></h1>
<p><b>Effective Date: October 19, 2017</b></p>
<h3 id="intro" style="font-size: 24px;">1. INTRODUCTION</h3>
<p>Dow Jones & Company, Inc., and its subsidiaries ("Dow Jones") want you to be familiar with how we collect, use and disclose information from and about you because we respect your concerns about privacy, and we want to maintain your trust.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies to information we collect from all sources, including in connection with our websites, mobile sites, applications ("apps"), widgets, conferences, events, and electronic newsletters or communications (collectively the "Dow Jones Services") that link to this Privacy Policy. If there is a conflict between this Policy and a Dow Jones Services corporate subscription agreement, the Dow Jones Services corporate subscription agreement will take precedence.</p>
<p>This Policy describes the types of Personal Data we collect, how we use it, and with whom we share it. It also describes generally Dow Jones' practices for handling Other Information (e.g., interests, demographics and services usage) collected through our Dow Jones Services or from a third party to the extent such information is associated with a particular device, user or user account. We also describe the measures we take to protect the information, your options for choice and access, and how you can contact us about privacy practices. As described more fully below, we share information with our subsidiaries, and affiliated companies ("Dow Jones Affiliates"), for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. A list of Dow Jones subsidiaries and Affiliates is available in annual reports accessible <a class="blue" href="http://investors.newscorp.com/sec-filings">here</a>. By using the Dow Jones Services, you acknowledge you have read and accept this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Your decision to use the Dow Jones Services and provide your Personal Data is voluntary. We indicate on our online, mobile, and other registration forms what types of Personal Data are requested. You may choose not to submit requested information online, or may choose to restrict the use of cookies (see <a class="blue" href="#otherInfo">Other Information</a> below, or our <a class="blue" href="./cookies-policy/">Cookie Policy</a>, for more information), but that may limit the services Dow Jones is able to provide to you.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones Services are a network of general audience sites, and are not targeted to, and do not knowingly collect Personal Data from, minors under 16 years of age. We request that these individuals do not provide Personal Data through the Dow Jones Services.</p>
<hr style="border-width: 1px 0px 0px; margin: 13px 25px 20px 0px;">
<h3 id="infoWeCollect" style="font-size: 24px;">2. WHAT WE COLLECT</h3>

<h3 id="security" style="font-size: 24px;">5. HOW WE PROTECT AND RETAIN PERSONAL DATA</h3>
<p>Dow Jones uses a combination of administrative, technical, personnel and physical measures to safeguard Personal Data in its possession against accidental, unlawful or unauthorized loss, use, access, disclosure or modification. We make reasonable efforts to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk of the processing, taking into account the costs of implementation and nature of the processing of Personal Data. However, no one can guarantee the complete safety of your information. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel the security of any account you might have with us has been compromised), please immediately notify us of the problem by contacting Customer Service in accordance with the instructions below.</p>
<p>We will retain your Personal Data for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or allowed by law.</p>
<hr style="border-width: 1px 0px 0px; margin: 13px 25px 20px 0px;">
<h3 id="rightsAndChoices" style="font-size: 24px;">6. YOUR RIGHTS AND CHOICES</h3>
<p><span style="color: #4f5b66; font-size: 20px;font-weight: 500;">6.1 Your Choices Regarding Our Use and Disclosure of Your Personal Data</span></p>
<p>We give you many choices regarding our use and disclosure of your Personal Data for marketing purposes.  </p>
<p><span style="color: #8d9ca9; font-size: 18px;font-weight: 500;">6.1.1 To Opt Out Of Direct Marketing From Dow Jones And Dow Jones Affiliates </span> </p>
<p>You may opt out of receiving electronic communications from us (including surveys, notifications, or promotions from us on behalf of third parties), or our sharing of your Personal Data with Dow Jones Affiliates for their direct marketing purposes, by changing your account settings through the appropriate link on the website account services page or following the unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of each email.  You can opt out of direct marketing from Dow Jones Affiliates by using the unsubscribe links they provide or following the steps in their applicable policies. </p>
<p>Please note that there are certain service notifications that you may not opt out of, such as renewal notices and notifications of changes to Dow Jones products and services or policies. If you have installed a mobile app and you wish to stop receiving push notifications, you can change the settings either on your mobile device or through the app.</p>
<p><span style="color: #8d9ca9; font-size: 18px;font-weight: 500;">6.1.2 To Opt Out Of Direct Marketing From Unaffiliated Third Parties </span> </p>
<p>You may also opt out from our sharing of your contact information with unaffiliated third parties for their marketing (which only applies if you are a WSJ U.S. edition or Barron’s print subscriber) by contacting Customer Service.</p>
<p><span style="color: #8d9ca9; font-size: 18px;font-weight: 500;">6.1.3 To Opt Out Of Online Interest-Based Or Text Advertising</span> </p>
<p>You may also opt out of online interest-based advertising by taking the steps detailed in our <a class="blue" href="./cookies-policy/">Cookie Policy</a>.</p>
<p>If you consented to receiving promotions or advertising via Text Message, you can unsubscribe from receiving Text Messages at any time by replying “STOP” to one of our Text Messages.</p>
<p><span style="color: #8d9ca9; font-size: 18px;font-weight: 500;">6.1.4 To Change Mobile App Privacy Settings </span></p>
<p>You may change the privacy settings for Dow Jones apps by accessing and updating privacy settings and permissions within the mobile app or on your mobile device.</p>
<p><span style="color: #4f5b66; font-size: 20px;">6.2 How To Access, Correct or Update Your Personal Data</span></p>
<p>You can access, review, correct, update, delete or modify your registration or subscription profile information and modify your marketing preferences by contacting Customer Service, as indicated below. Most subscribers and registered users can also update their Personal Data online by signing on to their accounts and visiting the appropriate account management sections of our websites. Please note that if you have subscribed or registered for our print and online editions, or for more than one of our publications or services, you may need to update your information for each separately. You can also object to or restrict the processing of your Personal Data. If you are in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), you can also exercise your right to data portability.</p>
<p>Here are links to pages where subscribers and registered users may update their personal profile information, marketing and newsletter preferences, or find local contact information for Dow Jones Services:</p>
<div style="padding-left:30px">
<ul>
<li><a class="blue" href="https://www.dowjones.com/contact/">Dow Jones Contact Page</a></li>
<li><a class="blue" href="http://online.wsj.com/public/page/email-setup.html">Wall Street Journal Emails and Alerts</a></li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Where you have provided your consent for our use of your Personal Data, you have the right to withdraw your consent and we will apply your preferences going forward.  </p>
<p>For your protection, we may only implement requests with respect to the Personal Data associated with the particular email address that you use to send us your request, and we may need to verify your identity before implementing your request. We will try to comply with your request as soon as reasonably practicable.</p>
<p>Please note that we may need to retain certain information for recordkeeping purposes and/or to complete any transactions you began prior to requesting such change or deletion (e.g., when you make a purchase or enter a promotion, you may not be able to change or delete the Personal Data provided until after the completion of such purchase or promotion).</p>
<p><span style="color: #4f5b66; font-size: 20px;">6.3 California Privacy Rights</span></p>
<p>Subject to certain limitations, California Law permits our customers who are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of Personal Data during the preceding calendar year to third parties for their own direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, California residents can write to us at <a class="blue" href="mailto:privacypolicy@dowjones.com">privacypolicy@dowjones.com</a>, Attn: DM Disclosure Manager, and include your name and the address to which you would like us to respond.</p>

<h3 id="otherInfo" style="font-size: 24px;">7. OTHER IMPORTANT INFORMATION</h3>
<p><span style="color: #4f5b66; font-size: 20px;">7.1 Updates to Privacy Policy</span></p>
<p>Dow Jones may periodically update this Privacy Policy without prior notice to reflect changes in our practices. Please look at the Effective Date at the top of this Privacy Policy to see when this Privacy Policy was last revised. Any changes to this Privacy Policy will become effective when we post the revised Privacy Policy on the Dow Jones Services. We will notify you by posting a prominent notice on the Dow Jones Services indicating we have updated this Privacy Policy. Your use of the Dow Jones Services or your provision of Personal Data to us following these changes means you acknowledge you have read and accept the revised Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><span style="color: #4f5b66; font-size: 20px;">7.2 Do Not Track Disclosure </span></p>
<p>Some browsers or other tools include “Do Not Track” (DNT) features which, when turned on, send a signal to websites you visit indicating you do not wish to be tracked across websites over time. However, since no technology standard for DNT signals has been developed or adopted to date, Dow Jones does not currently respond to DNT signals.  </p>
<p><span style="color: #4f5b66; font-size: 20px;">7.3 Transfers</span></p>
<p>Your Personal Data may be stored, transferred to, and processed in any country where we have facilities or in which we engage service providers. These countries may be outside your country of residence, including the United States, and may have different data protection laws than in your country.</p>
<p>If you are located in the EEA, we will implement appropriate safeguards to protect your Personal Data as required if we transfer it outside the EEA.</p>
<p><span style="color: #4f5b66; font-size: 20px;">7.4 Collection of Personal Financial Information by a Payment Service </span></p>
<p>In some cases, we may use an unaffiliated payment service to allow you to purchase a product or make payments (“Payment Service”). If you wish to purchase a product or make a payment in such a case, you will be directed to a Payment Service webpage. Any information that you provide to a Payment Service will be subject to the applicable Payment Service’s privacy policy, rather than this Privacy Policy. We have no control over, and are not responsible for, any Payment Service’s use of information collected through any Payment Service.</p>
